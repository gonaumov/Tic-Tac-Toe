# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my work on [JetBrains Academy's](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/)
 [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48) project which is part of Java Developer track.
 
 ## How to run it ?
 If you want to run it from command line only you can use this one liner: 
```
git clone https://github.com/gonaumov/Tic-Tac-Toe.git && cd Tic-Tac-Toe/src/ && javac ./tictactoe/Main.java && java tictactoe.Main
```
